This is probably going to be an arduino project but may move to micropython for security.

Goals in order of priority;

control sk6812 and ws2812/ws2811 lighting based on inbound strings.
return responses.
http/https web interface.
server side macros/routines/scripts executable from inbound strings..
sensors.
servos???
reactjs???
micropython.
ssl.
